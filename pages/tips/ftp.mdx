# FTP/SSH 

Using FTP/SSH is significantly easier and faster then attempting to edit stuff right off of a VPS, esspecially when in production. Additional services like VS Code, a browser etc running on the VPS will degrade performance and may cause lag in game. There's dozens of tutorials on how to setup FileZilla server or another FTP server on a windows VPS. If you're on linux, OpenSSH includes one, just using the same information you would use to SSH.

# Utilizing Git/GitHub
Utlizing github/git in general is extremely helpful, especially when you need to keep track of changes or are working within a team. It helps promote organization and cleanliness and also has more security. You can also automatically deploy changes to your production server, or to a dev server, etc. 

This goes for resource creation & server development. 

Here are some good resources to begin.

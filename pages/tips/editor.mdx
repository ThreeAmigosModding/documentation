# Using an actual text editor/IDE

Please, **PLEASE** use an actual code editor/IDE such as Visual Studio Code. We see way too many people using notepad to edit files, even notepad++ isn't a good option as it lacks important and extremely useful features. We'll include some links to a few good ones and useful extension or plugins for them.

## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) is probably the best code editor i've ever used, its extremely popular, versatile, and customizable for any need. 

[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### VS Code extensions
Here are some very popular and extremely helpful extensions we recommend using. Please be sure to configure them to your specific needs.

## Atom
Atom is made by github, however it is now deprecated. If you still want to use it, you can still download it [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.60.0)

## Sublime Text

Sublime Text is the text editor I first started using before I found VS Code. It's lightweight and versatile, and has a lot of features built in, however its not nearly as customizable as Visual Studio Code.

[Download Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

***We highly discourage the use of Notepad++ as it lacks extremely important and useful features, plus its a bit clunky.***

# Organizing

Organizing your resources help significantly with workflow and lets you know what a resource is. We usually organize resources by their type (MLO, Scripts, etcetera). Here's an example of how we run our resource structure.

*Please note, some resources may require to be in the default root resources folder, not in a category.*

```
resources/ # Your server's root resources folder
 [cfx-default] # All of the default CFX resources
 [vehicles] # Vehicles on your server
 [vehicles]/[leo] # All LEO vehicles
 [vehices]/[fire] # All Fire vehicles
 [vehicles]/[civ] # All civilian vehicles
 [scripts] # Scripts go here
 [eup/ped/player] # All your EUP, playermodels, etcetra would go here
 [maps/mlos] # All your maps/MLOs
 [weapons] # All of your weapons go here
```

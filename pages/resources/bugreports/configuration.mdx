# Configuration

On this page we will go over how to configure TAM_BugReports. All configuration files are in the `data/` directory or are done via convars.


## Main Configuration

The primary configuration file is `data/configuration.lua`. Here you will find all of the primary configuration options.
```lua
config.cooldown = 300000 -- Cooldown time in miliseconds. This is set to 300000 (15 minutes) by default.

config.identifier = 'license' -- The identifier to link to the player. Will be formated like:  Username | Identifier. Available options are: https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/lua/functions/GetPlayerIdentifiers/#license-types

config.loggerEnabled = false -- Should we use ox_libs logger functionality?

config.githubEnabled = false -- Should we create a github issue when a user submits a bug report?

config.discordEnabled = true -- Should we send a Discord embed via webhook when a user submits a bug report?

config.embedConfig = {
    username = "TAM_BugReports", -- The bots username
    logo = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThreeAmigosModding/ThreeAmigosModding/refs/heads/main/img/tam_logo_1k.png" -- Direct image link to the bots profile picture.
}

config.keybind = {
    enabled = true, -- Should there be a keybind setup to open the UI?
    defaultKey = "F10"
}

config.severity = { -- List of available severity options
    "Minor",
    "Major",
    "Critical"
}

config.types = { -- List of available bug report types.
    "Other",
    "Graphics",
    "UI",
    "Performance",
    "Audio",
    "NPCs",
    "Animation",
    "Interaction",
    "Terrain/Map",
    "Vehicle",
    "PVP"
}
```

## Convar Configuration

These convars are used for confidential information that shouldn't be replicated to the client.
```bash
set tamReports:githubToken "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" # Your github personal access token
set tamReports:githubRepo "REPO_NAME" # The github repository name to open the issue on.
set tamReports:githubOrg "ORG_NAME" # The github organization / user that owns the github repository.
set tamReports:discordWebhook "DISCORD_WEBHOOK" # The webhook URL to send discord messages to.
```

## Locals / Language

All of the respective language/locales can be changed in the `locales` directory. 

Users can set their language via the `/ox_lib` command in-game if its enabled. If the language file doesn't exist, it defaults to English.

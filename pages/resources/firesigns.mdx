### Spawns

You can remove or add custom locations around the map in the `data/spawns.lua` file. Be sure to follow this format:

  ```lua
      local spawns = {
        {	
            coords = {	-- xyz coordinants of where the sign should be.
                x = -1488.623779296875,
                y =  4989.982421875, 	
                z = 63.20363998413086	
            },	
            heading = 49.19453811645508, -- heading or rotation of the sign. May have to add 90 to it.
            model = `tam_firesign_a`-- model hash to spawn. Do not use GetHashKey()!
        }, -- don't forget a comma here.
      }
  ```

### Locales
  
You can easily change all locales in the `locales` directory. Edit the .json file of the respective language you want to change. Clients are able to set their preferred language via `/ox_lib` command. See more information [here](https://overextended.dev/ox_lib/Modules/Locale/Shared)

If you want to add a new language, simply copy one of the .json files and rename it to the relative [ISO Language Code](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm), then begin translating. If you wish to submit your translate to be release, please open a ticket in our Discord.

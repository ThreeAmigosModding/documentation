# Installation

This will go over the installation guide for TAM_Fuel. Please be sure to read this carefully and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in our Discord.

<Steps>

### Install & setup all dependencies
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest)
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target/releases/latest) (Highly Recommended) **OR** [qb-target](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target). **You do not need both!**
- Make sure your server artifacts version is `9000` or above. Downloaded the [Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) or [Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/) artifacts.
- Make sure your game build is set to 2802 or higher. See how to set your gamebuild [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuilds-on-fivem/4784977).
- Make sure your server is running OneSync (Formally Onesync Infinity) and **not** legacy. See how to enable onesync [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/onesync-infinity-how-to-use-it/996612).

### Install optional dependencies
(These are entirely optional and are not required for the resource to work.)
- [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/releases/latest) (Highly Recommended) **OR** [qb-inventory](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-inventory). **You do not need both!**

### Download the latest release from [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net)

### Add the resources to your server.cfg (or resources.cfg)

```bash
start ox_lib
start framework # the name of your framework (i.e. ND_Core, es_extended, qbx_core). This is not necessary if you are using standalone.
start ox_target # or qb-target. Though we prefer you use ox_target
start ox_inventory # Optional, you do not need this.
start TAM_Fuel
```

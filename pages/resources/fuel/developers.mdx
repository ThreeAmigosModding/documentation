# Fuel developer documenation

Here you will find a basic list of how you can modify our resource if you are a developer. This assumes you have *at minimum* basic knowledge of how FiveM works and the lua scripting language.

## Setting fuel

```lua
Entity(vehicleId).state.fuelLevel = fuelAmount
```

## Getting fuel

```lua
local fuelLevel = Entity(vehicleId).state.fuelLevel
```

## Configuring your own integrations

All of the bridge files are located in `modules/bridge` directory. This requires decent knowledge of the lua scripting language and how FiveM works. This is mostly unsupported and you're on your own.

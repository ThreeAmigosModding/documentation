<Steps>

### Install & setup all dependencies
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest)
- Make sure your server artifacts version is `12000` or above. Downloaded the [Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) or [Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/) artifacts.
- Make sure your game build is set to 2802 or higher. See how to set your gamebuild [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuilds-on-fivem/4784977).
- Make sure your server is running OneSync (Formally Onesync Infinity) and **not** legacy. See how to enable onesync [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/onesync-infinity-how-to-use-it/996612).

### Install optional dependencies
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target/releases/latest) **This is optional, however some features will not work without it**
- [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/releases/latest) **This is optional, however some features will not work without it**

### Download the latest release from [CFX Portal](https://portal.cfx.re)

### (Optional) Configure resource integrations
    This is optional, add these to your server.cfg above where the resources start.
```bash
    # Three Amigos Modding Cross-Resource Configuration
    # "auto" will automatically detect compatible resources/frameworks.

    setr tam:framework "auto" # "auto" | "qb" | "qbx" | "nd" | "esx" | "ox"

    setr tam:inventory "auto" # "auto" | "ox"

    setr tam:target "auto" # "auto" | "ox" 

    setr tam:notifications "ox" # "ox"
```

### (Required if using inventory) Add the items & images.

Add the items from `_INSTALL/items/items.lua` to your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` & the images from `_INSTALL/items/images` to the `ox_inventory/web/images` directory.

### Add the resources to your server.cfg (or resources.cfg)

```bash
start ox_lib
start framework # the name of your framework (i.e. ND_Core, es_extended, qbx_core). This is not necessary if you are using standalone.
start ox_target # Optional
start ox_inventory # Optional
start TAM_Police
```
